🔐 Caesar Cipher — Python Project

A Python implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher, a simple yet powerful encryption technique that shifts letters through the alphabet to encode or decode messages.
This project was built as part of my #90DaysOfCode challenge to improve logic building, string manipulation, and clean modular programming.

✅ Features

Encode & Decode Support
Easily shift letters forward (encode) or backward (decode).
Custom Shift Values
Users can choose any shift number.
Wrap-around Logic
Letters correctly loop from z → a and vice-versa.
ASCII Logo
A separate module (ascii.py) handles the project’s banner for clean structure.
Error-resistant
Non-alphabet characters (spaces, symbols, numbers) are preserved as-is.

🎮 How It Works
The user chooses:
"encode" → encrypt
"decode" → decrypt
The user provides:
A message
A shift number
The program applies the Caesar Cipher and prints the final result.

🧠 Concepts Practiced

String manipulation
Lists and indexing
Loops and conditionals
Modular code structure
Handling user input
Basic cryptography principles

▶️ Example Usage
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt
encode
Type your message:
hello world
Type shift number:
5
Here is the encoded result: mjqqt btwqi

🚀 Part of #90DaysOfCode
This project is one of the daily Python builds in my 90 Days of Code challenge, focused on improving consistency, problem-solving, and hands-on programming skills.
